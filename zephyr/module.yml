# Delete all unused properties.

# Give your module a name
name: zmk-driver-device-detector
build:
  # List your dependencies
  # (Dependencies are typically handled via Kconfig symbols like ADC, LOG, etc.)
  cmake: . # Path to CMakeLists.txt relative to this file
  kconfig: Kconfig # Path to Kconfig file relative to this file
  settings:
    # board_root: . # Path to 'boards' folder relative to this file
    dts_root: . # Path to 'dts' folder (dts/bindings) relative to this file
    # snippet_root: . # Path to 'snippets' folder relative to this file

# The actual paths for cmake, kconfig, and dts_root are often specified directly
# in the build section or are inferred if following standard Zephyr module structure.
# Based on our current setup and common practice:
# No 'depends' section needed here if not depending on other custom ZMK modules explicitly by name.
